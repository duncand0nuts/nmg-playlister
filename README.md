~A python webapp to create youtube playlists from facebook group comment threads~

Because sometimes awesome threads have tons of good tracks posted up on them but I never get round to clicking through all of them.


The basic plan so far is to generate a python webapp which will take a facebook group post URL as input,
and output a playlist on youtube of all the youtube links in the comments on the post.
